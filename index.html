        <h1>Greetings Summoner 🤡</h1>
        <p>
          <br>I'm your jungler! I like to play jungler which need a lot of farm → champs like Shyvana, BelVeth, Viego and so on... 
          If you want to check out my profile [<a href="https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/summoner/euw/p4s3r0#championsData-all-queues">porofessor</a>] [<a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/p4s3r0">op.gg</a>]. <br><br>
          The nice part about farming in jungle is that you get a LOT of gold 🪙 for a small amount of risk. After i got a fair amount of gold, I can 
          deal a loooot of damage 💥. That sounds great doesn't it? Farming, earning gold with no risk, and after the early phase of the game, having
          a lot of impact! <br><br>
          When I'm playing Shyvana 🐉 (← thats Shyvana), which is probably the case, I need to farm until im level 6! If I didn't reach level 6, I will probably NOT gank your lane.
          If you ping me to come to your lane, I will very likely ignore it 🥴. Except you are dead, then I will take your minions (if I'm in a good mood, 
          i will freeze your lane, but I wouldn't count on that). <br><br>
          On the right corner above your minimap, you will see that my ultimate is ready 🟢. That does not mean, that my ultimate is ready, you have to check
          my fury 😡! The green dot will always show up (if lvl >= 6). <br><br>
          I will try to get the first drake at the moment when it spawns. So please push out your wave and try to get prio. If you can't get prio (especially bot lane),
          try to ward the drake! I would appreciate that 😊. <br><br>
          if you decide to feed your ass off, atleast keep your mouth shut. If somebody flames you, there is a mute button 🔇. I know that you are the best player 
          EUW and the only thing what is keeping you back are your teammates. But actually nobody cares baby Faker 🤡. <br><br>
